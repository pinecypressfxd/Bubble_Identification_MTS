# Bubble_Identification_MTS

The plasma-sheet bubble identification models are for Paper "Plasma-Sheet Bubble Identification Using Multivariate Time Series Classification". The paper is subbmitted to Journal of Geophysical Research. 

This code consists of two parts, including "model_construction" and "predict_code".

The best trained model result is in the folder "best_model_result".


# How can we use our model to predict outcomes?

One can modify the code to predict new data based on the prediction code in the “predict_code” folder.

# Extension

This code is very easily to add more input parameters. One can expand on this to train one's own model.

# Acknowledgement
Our models' architecture is based on the "dl-4-tsc" repository. We would like to thank the providers of the “dl-4-tsc” repository (https://github.com/hfawaz/dl-4-tsc). We would also like to thank "sktime" repository (https://github.com/sktime/sktime).
