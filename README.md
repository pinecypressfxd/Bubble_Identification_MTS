# Bubble_Identification_MTS

The plasma-sheet bubble identification model is for Paper "Plasma-Sheet Bubble Identification Using Multivariate Time Series Classification". The paper is subbmitted to Journal of Geophysical Research.

This code consists of two parts, including model building code and prediction code.

The best trained model is in the folder "model result".

# How can we use our model to predict outcomes?


# Extension
This code is very easily to add more input parameters. One can expand on this to train one's own model.
